# notify-frontend

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Points
- localstorage can be used to reduce first fold of view
- can be translated with i8n module
- I didn't know if the views has to be separate but I kept them separate since notes and checklist are two different things.
